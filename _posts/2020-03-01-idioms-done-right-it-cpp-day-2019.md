title: Idioms, you're doing it right
subtitle: Italian C++ Day 2019
tags: [talk, cpp]

[These]({{ site.baseurl }}/pdf/idioms_done_right.pdf) are the slides of a talk
I gave at the
[Italian C++ Day 2019](https://www.italiancpp.org/2019/12/26/cppday19/) in
Parma. The conference was organized by the
[Italian C++ Community](https://www.italiancpp.org/).<br/>
The goal of the talk was to describe the evolution of the language from the
point of view of its _idioms_. I tried to analyze how the latter had been
influenced by the different revisions of the standard.<br/>
A particular reading key of a little discussed topic that the participants seem
to have liked fortunately.

In just 50 minutes I went through as many idioms as possible, trying to
entertain the attendees while still leaving them something to take away.<br/>
The beginner saw what the more experienced had to go through at the time, the
seasoned programmer instead took a peek at C++20.

I was a little skeptical about the topic chosen because it risked being a big
fail. However, all in all the feedback was excellent and I hope the presentation
was useful for many.
